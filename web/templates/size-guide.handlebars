                1. To measure your feet take a piece of paper down to the floor. You are going to trace an outline of your barefoot onto
                this paper, so pick a hard surface that&#39;s easy to draw on.
                <br>
                <br> 2. Place your foot firmly on top of the piece of paper. Bend your leg slightly, with your shin in front
                of your ankle.
                <br>
                <br> 3. Trace your foot. Draw the outline of your foot all the way around. Be precise.
                <br>
                <br> 4. Mark the length of your foot on the paper. Use your marker to draw straight line touching each side of
                the outline.
                <br>
                <br> 5. Measure the length of your foot. Use a tape measure or ruler to measure from the big toe to heel of your
                foot. This number determine your shoe size.
                <br>
                <br> One foot is often slightly larger than the other. For best results, follow these steps for both feet.
